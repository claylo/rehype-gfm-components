These are the actual design documents and implementation plans used to build this project. They were written collaboratively with Claude Code, an AI coding agent, and executed through agentic workflows.

We're publishing them because we think the era of hiding how software gets made is over. AI-assisted development is a tool, like a compiler or a linter. The interesting part isn't that an agent was involved — it's whether the architecture holds up, the code works, and the design decisions were sound.

Judge the output, not the process. :shipit:

## Documents

- [Design Document](./2026-02-13-rehype-gfm-components-design) — Architecture, GFM conventions, component catalog, and the Mintlify cross-reference that shaped the v1 scope
- [Implementation Plan](./2026-02-13-implementation-plan) — The step-by-step task breakdown used to build the plugin, complete with the agent directives that drove execution
