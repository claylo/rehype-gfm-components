Every component below is written in plain GFM Markdown. No imports, no JSX, no MDX. HTML comments serve as invisible upgrade markers — your content reads naturally on GitHub and renders as rich interactive components in Starlight.

## Structure your content

- [Steps](/components/steps/) — Numbered instructions with visual guide lines
- [Tabs](/components/tabs/) — Switchable tabbed views from details/summary groups
- [File Tree](/components/filetree/) — Interactive file tree from a code block

## Highlight content

- [Cards](/components/cards/) — Styled containers with icons from blockquotes
- [Link Cards](/components/linkcards/) — Clickable cards with title and description
- [Link Button](/components/linkbutton/) — Styled button links with variants

## Inline elements

- [Badge](/components/badge/) — Inline labels and status indicators
- [Icon](/components/icon/) — Inline SVG icons from Starlight's icon set

## Progressive enhancement

These components require no comment markers at all — standard GFM constructs are automatically enhanced.

- [Accordion](/components/accordion/) — Styled expandable sections from details/summary
- [Tooltips](/components/tooltips/) — Inline tooltips from GFM footnotes
